KYC verification stands for the Know Your Client or the Know Your Customer rule. Abbreviated to KYC, it is an internationally applied procedure that businesses use to verify client identity and assess suitability to reduce the risk of illegal practices, such as money laundering, and comply with banking regulations.

In the financial and banking sectors, KYC verification stands for a mandatory due diligence process that clients must go through before getting access to services provided by a business, particularly regarding AML (anti-money laundering) checks and detection of Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs).

The latest advances in technology allow companies to carry out their KYC verification services with ease from anywhere in the world. This reduces stress on clients having to send documents via postal services or visit a brick and mortar branch to verify their identity.
