== Contract Sign Process

This diagram shows sequence of steps of Contract Sign Process.

The main parts of common system:

* Client - Mobile SDK or Web SDK that integrated in the vendor application
* Merchant Application Area - Pack of technical tools that we provide to vendor
** Application - Middleware server which communicate with SDKs
** DB - Database which store all data (clients, applications, statistics)
** Operator - Person who will communicate with clients and will process applications
