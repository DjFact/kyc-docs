= How It Works?

== Full Process

This diagram shows how all parts of common system are interacted with each other.

The main parts of common system:

 * Client - Mobile SDK or Web SDK that integrated in the vendor application
 * Merchant Application Area - Pack of technical tools that we provide to vendor
    ** Application - Middleware server which communicate with SDKs
    ** DB - Database which store all data (clients, applications, statistics)
    ** Operator - Person who will communicate with clients and will process applications
 * Third-party APIs - Third-party services, for example (SMS provider, BankID, Diia etc)
 * Merchant System - Vendor's own IT system
 * ELKYC Applications - Electronic KYC Solutions System
